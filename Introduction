INTEREST IN IT

•	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My interest in IT started as a child.  I always enjoyed playing computer games.  I remember playing N64 with my brothers.

•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

RMIT has a good reputation for Information Technology.  I need to study outside of hours, so open universities works for me.

•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I expect to learn the basics of IT, and to develop a passion for a particular area of IT.

IDEAL JOB

My ideal job would be a Support Officer.  ie

https://www.iress.com/au/company/join-us/listing/support-officer/

This job is attactive to me because it is an entry level role.

I think I would be exposed to a wide variety of IT related problems, and I would develop skills very quickly.  As someone who is new to the IT industry I think the role would be perfect for me.

The role is an entry level role so a Bachelor of IT from RMIT would be suitable skills, qualifications and experience for the role.  Accordingly, I am a few years away from being able to undertake this role.

At present, I only have basic skils in IT, so would not be ready to undertake the role.  I would not be able to provide the necessary support required for the role.

My plan would be to pass my Bachelor of IT from RMIT, and also to obtain industry experience along the way, to set me up and make me able to undertake this role.

https://365tests.com/personality-tests/male-or-female-brain/

I had a Balanced Brain.

"Your brain is probably close to what scientists call a balanced brain, halfway between female and male, though possibly leaning more towards the male end. You like to take a proactive approach to problem-solving, and you're not afraid to take the lead. Sometimes you might not show enough appreciation of other people's ideas or feelings in your eagerness to put your own forward."

•	What do the results of these tests mean for you?

•	How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

•	How should you take this into account when forming a team?
